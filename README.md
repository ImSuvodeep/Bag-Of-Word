# Bag-Of-Word
Explore the simplicity and efficiency of our Bag of Words (BoW) model on GitHub. This versatile text analysis solution transforms text into numerical vectors for tasks like sentiment analysis and document classification.


This Python script demonstrates a simple yet effective spam classification model using the Bag of Words (BoW) technique. Key steps include reading a dataset (spam.csv), preprocessing, and utilizing the Scikit-learn library for vectorization and classification. The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is employed for training and evaluation, with a focus on generating a classification report.

Additionally, a concise alternative is showcased using the Scikit-learn Pipeline, combining vectorization and model training in a streamlined manner. This enables efficient spam classification with minimal code complexity. Real-world examples are provided to showcase the model's predictive capabilities.
